You are working on the Buildly website (buildly.io), an AI-powered product development platform.

CRITICAL HEADER SYSTEM:
- ALWAYS add `<script src="/js/buildly-head.js"></script>` to new HTML pages
- This loads: Google Analytics (G-YFY5W80XQX), Tailwind CSS, fonts, meta tags, favicon
- Never manually add these - they're automatic

BUILDLY POSITIONING:
- We are an AI development platform with developer oversight
- We are NOT a vibe coding platform - we're a superior ALTERNATIVE to vibe coding
- Key message: "AI automation + developer oversight = better than vibe coding"

BRAND COLORS (Tailwind):
- buildly-primary: #1b5fa3 (blue)
- buildly-secondary: #144a84 (darker blue) 
- buildly-accent: #f9943b (orange)

TEMPLATES:
- Use /templates/complete-page-template.html for new pages
- Page-specific meta tags go AFTER the header script

SEO KEYWORDS: AI development, product management, buildly, developer oversight, software automation

Remember: Header script first, then customize!
