                    The way we manage products is evolving rapidly. Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just a futuristic concept—it's here, and it's transforming industries. In product management, AI is unlocking new possibilities, from streamlining workflows to providing deeper insights into customer needs.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                    This new era of AI-powered tools is enabling teams to work faster and smarter while focusing on creativity and strategy. Among these tools, Buildly's Labs app stands out, offering features that redefine how product managers plan, execute, and deliver.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-buildly-dark mb-6">The Role of AI in Product Management</h2>
                
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    Product management has always been a balancing act. Teams must analyze markets, understand customer needs, and manage complex projects—all while meeting tight deadlines. AI is stepping in to ease these challenges, particularly in two key areas:
                </p>

                <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
                    <div class="bg-buildly-light p-6 rounded-lg">
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-buildly-primary mb-3">1. Market Analysis</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">AI can sift through enormous datasets, identifying trends and patterns that might take humans days or weeks to uncover. It helps product managers understand market shifts and competitor strategies in real-time, enabling faster decision-making.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bg-buildly-light p-6 rounded-lg">
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-buildly-primary mb-3">2. Customer Insights</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">By analyzing customer feedback, purchasing behaviors, and sentiment data, AI provides a clearer picture of what customers want. These insights allow teams to create products that truly meet user needs, often predicting demand before it even arises.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                    Beyond these, AI streamlines processes by automating repetitive tasks, freeing up human creativity for high-value activities. This is where Buildly's Labs app comes in.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-buildly-dark mb-6">Buildly's AI-Driven Product Management Features</h2>
                
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                    Buildly's Labs app leverages AI to enhance every stage of product management, from ideation to execution. Here's how it's setting a new standard:
                </p>

                <!-- Feature 1 -->
                <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-50 to-emerald-50 p-8 rounded-xl mb-8">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">1. Enhanced Speed and Efficiency with Automated Feature Generation</h3>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Imagine no longer having to brainstorm and draft feature descriptions manually. The Labs app generates detailed, relevant feature definitions automatically based on project goals and team inputs.
                    </p>

                    <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg">
                        <p class="text-green-700 font-medium">
                            This automation eliminates tedious administrative work, allowing teams to focus on planning and execution. The result? Faster workflows and more time for strategic decision-making.
                        </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        User stories are critical for aligning development teams with user needs, but creating them manually can be time-consuming. The Labs app simplifies this process by generating user stories tailored to various roles, such as users and admins.
                    </p>

                    <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg">

                            These AI-suggested stories ensure no perspective is overlooked, improving communication and reducing the need for revisions. Teams can edit and customize these stories as needed, ensuring they align perfectly with project requirements.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <!-- Feature 3 -->

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">3. Seamless Conversion of Features to Issue Tickets</h3>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Once features are created, the Labs app instantly converts them into issue tickets. This automation breaks down high-level goals into actionable tasks for both front-end and back-end development.
                    </p>

                    <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg">
                        <p class="text-purple-700 font-medium">

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Keeping track of multiple tasks and issues across a project can be overwhelming. The Labs app offers a centralized roadmap view, where all issues—generated or custom—are organized in one place.
                    </p>

                    <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg">

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Releasing a product involves coordinating timelines, dependencies, and resources—a complex puzzle that AI helps solve. The Labs app uses AI to optimize release planning by identifying bottlenecks, analyzing resource availability, and suggesting actionable solutions.
