                    Let's be honest: if you're a product manager today, chances are you're working with — or about to work with — artificial intelligence. Whether it's a simple recommendation engine, an AI-powered chatbot, or a full-blown predictive model, AI is rapidly becoming a core part of how we design and ship products.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                    And it's exciting… but also a little intimidating. Especially when the conversation turns to ethical AI.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                    You might be thinking: "I'm not a data scientist — how am I supposed to lead on ethics when I barely have time to groom the backlog?"
                </p>

                <div class="bg-buildly-light p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
                    <p class="text-lg font-medium text-buildly-primary mb-2">The Truth Is:</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">You don't need to code a model to advocate for ethical AI. What you do need is context, curiosity, and the confidence to ask hard questions early and often.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-buildly-dark mb-6">First, Let's Acknowledge the Challenge</h2>
                
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    Ethics in AI is messy. It's not always clear-cut, and there aren't always best practices you can copy-paste into your next sprint. But ignoring the conversation is a risk in itself.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                    AI can unintentionally amplify bias, invade privacy, or create real harm if we're not thoughtful — especially when it's powering decisions that affect people's lives. PMs are in a unique position because we sit at the intersection of business goals, user needs, and engineering execution. That means we're also the ones who can spot red flags early and start important conversations.
                </p>

                <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-6 mb-8">
                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        <strong>Important:</strong> Customers and stakeholders are increasingly expecting ethical AI leadership from product teams.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-buildly-dark mb-6">So What Can You Actually Do?</h2>
                
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                    You don't need to be a machine learning expert to lead on ethics — but you do need to bring ethical thinking into your product process, not just bolt it on at the end.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        One of the biggest ethical risks in AI product development isn't the model — it's the lack of visibility in how product decisions get made. Without a clear line of sight from business goals to features to data usage, it's easy to overlook critical questions like: What are we building? Why? And who could be affected?
                    </p>

                    <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">

                            Buildly Labs uses AI to help product managers create structured, transparent product plans — not just specs in a doc, but a living blueprint of how the product evolves over time. You don't need to be a data scientist to lead on ethics — you just need a tool that keeps the big picture visible, and makes collaboration intentional.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mt-6">
                        When AI is involved, clarity is everything. Labs brings structure to the product process, so ethical considerations aren't lost in Slack threads or buried in a spreadsheet. It becomes easier to track intent, assumptions, and impact — and to course-correct when needed.

                        You don't need to carry the ethics flag alone. Loop in design early — they're great allies in thinking about user experience, inclusion, and communication. Engineers can help flag technical limitations or constraints that might raise ethical issues. Even marketing and sales teams can provide insights into how AI is perceived on the frontlines.

                    You don't need to know how to tune a model. You just need to be the person in the room who says, "Have we thought through how this might affect our users — especially if the AI gets it wrong?"
