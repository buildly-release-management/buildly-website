                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-800 mb-4">Bias and Fairness</h3>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Resolving bias in algorithms is one of the biggest problems facing AI development. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems pick up on prejudices in the data they are fed, and they have the ability to reinforce and magnify those biases.
