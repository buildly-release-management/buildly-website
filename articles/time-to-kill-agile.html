            <h1>ðŸª“ It's Time to Kill Agile (for Most Use Cases)</h1><h3>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greglind">Gregory Lind</a></h3><p><em>Founder & CEO of <a href="https://www.buildly.io">Buildly</a> | Author of <a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484294933">Radical Therapy for Software Teams</a></em></p><p>---</p><p>I've been an Agile evangelist and a Scrum team member â€” if you will â€” on many projects and in many organizations over the years.</p><p>I've stood on both sides of the aisle, or maybe more accurately, both sides of the stand-up circle.</p><p>I've been the <strong>developer</strong> just wanting to get to work, quietly hoping that the promise of fewer meetings and fewer artifacts would one day come true.</p><p>And I've been the <strong>Project Manager</strong> and <strong>Scrum Master</strong>, hoping the developers might show just a little more flexibility â€” maybe include an estimate (even a wild guess), or at least show up on time for stand-up.</p><p>What I know is that the <strong>reaction to waterfall and big-up-front design</strong> was absolutely correct in most cases.</p><p>Agile, in all its flavors and customizations, helped bring countless projects back to life and get delivered on time.</p><p>But it didn't solve every problem, and it created plenty of new ones â€” with its own detractors and dysfunctions that still linger today.</p><p>And now, I believe it's time â€” in most cases â€” for Agile to <strong>die</strong>.</p><p>Some teams have already taken the axe to it. Others are trimming carefully with scalpels.</p><p>Many are searching for alternatives in <strong>Lean</strong>, <strong>Six Sigma</strong>, or new home-grown versions of Agile â€” and that's fine. In fact, that's exactly in the spirit of the original manifesto.</p><p>As the <strong>12th Principle</strong> of the <em>Agile Manifesto</em> reminds us:</p><p>> "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."</p><p>For many of us now working with <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>aggressive CI/CD</strong>, or even older <strong>component-driven architectures</strong>, the pace of real work has outgrown Agile's cycles and ceremonies.</p><p>We've hit that regular interval again â€” and it's time to tune and adjust.</p><p>In other words: it's time to <strong>kill Agile</strong>, or at least start hacking away until there's almost nothing left.</p><p>---</p><h2>The Radical Shift</h2><p>After two decades helping teams find the balance between structure and flow, I've watched Agile grow from revolutionary to routine â€” and now, to restrictive.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.buildly.io">Buildly</a> and inside <a href="https://labs.buildly.io">Buildly Labs</a>, we've spent the last few years stripping back what doesn't serve us anymore.</p><p>What's left we call the <strong>Radical Process</strong>, an evolution of the ideas I first explored in <em><a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484294933">Radical Therapy for Software Teams</a></em>.</p><p>It's still rooted in trust, collaboration, and reflection â€” but now it's enhanced with automation, AI, and a deep understanding of how modern remote and hybrid teams actually work.</p><p>This isn't an anti-Agile rant.</p><p>It's the natural continuation of what the manifesto asked us to do: <strong>reflect, adapt, and evolve</strong>.</p><p>---</p><h2>How Buildly Labs and AI Changed the Process</h2><p>At Buildly, we didn't throw Agile out overnight. We just started trimming.</p><p>Meetings that produced no new insight were cut.</p><p>Ceremonies that slowed real work were automated or absorbed into daily flow.</p><p>And the result was a process that moves as fast as the teams â€” and the tools â€” driving it.</p><h3>Key Shifts</h3><p>* <strong>Automation over administration</strong></p><p>  Buildly Labs automates what used to require planning meetings and manual updates.</p><p>  Our AI generates features, splits issues across multiple Git repositories, and plans releases on hourly or daily intervals â€” not two-week sprints.</p><p>* <strong>Context where the work lives</strong></p><p>  Instead of juggling Jira tickets and Slack threads, everything happens in one space.</p><p>  Business and design teams can comment directly within Labs, integrating notes from Trello, Figma, or chat logs without extra licenses or hand-offs.</p><p>* <strong>The new rhythm is continuous</strong></p><p>  With tools like ChatGPT, Co-Pilot, and "vibe coding" prototypes, developers can research, code, test, and deploy before the next backlog grooming would even begin.</p><p>  The old rituals can't keep up â€” and that's okay.</p><p>---</p><h2>Radical in Practice</h2><p>The tipping point came when we realized most sprint cycles were already <strong>outdated the moment they started</strong>.</p><p>By the time a story moved from grooming to development, an AI-assisted prototype was often already in place.</p><p>So we experimented with what we now call <strong>Radical Intervals</strong> â€” micro-loops of continuous planning and delivery.</p><p>AI monitors code activity, meetings, and issue threads, surfacing new features or blockers automatically.</p><p>Teams can react and deploy in real time, without waiting for a new sprint to start.</p><p>Retrospectives still happen â€” but asynchronously, inside the workflow.</p><p>AI summarizes what's working, what's slowing teams down, and even recommends changes.</p><p>The outcome is a <strong>self-correcting process</strong> â€” one that adapts itself, rather than waiting for a manager to call a meeting.</p><p>It's not Agile. It's not Lean. It's something leaner still: <strong>Radical</strong>.</p><p>As <a href="https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html">Dave Thomas</a>, one of the original signatories of the <em>Agile Manifesto</em>, wrote over a decade ago:</p><p>> "Once you put a capital A in Agile, it stops being agile."</p><p>That line has aged like fine wine.</p><p>What began as a movement of freedom became a bureaucracy of certifications and checklists.</p><p>Even mainstream business writers agree.</p><p>* <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/04/have-we-taken-agile-too-far">Harvard Business Review</a> asked whether we've pushed Agile beyond its usefulness.</p><p>* <a href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/end-agile-why-agile-should-be-replaced">TechBeacon</a> declared "The End of Agile."</p><p>* <a href="https://tdan.com/the-end-of-agile-part-2-critiques-of-agile/31699">TDAN</a> cataloged its critics.</p><p>  All point to the same truth: the framework that once freed us now often slows us down.</p><p>---</p><h2>Conclusion: Reflection, Not Rebellion</h2><p>Agile isn't the enemy. It was a necessary correction to the rigidity of waterfall.</p><p>But software development has changed again.</p><p>AI, automation, and continuous deployment have permanently altered the rhythm of building.</p><p>We can't afford processes designed for slower, more predictable cycles.</p><p>The <strong>Radical Process</strong> is simply the next reflection â€” the next adjustment â€” in the spirit of that 12th principle.</p><p>It's about cutting back to what really matters: communication, clarity, and constant adaptation.</p><p>It's about letting automation handle the repetition, so humans can focus on creation.</p><p>If Agile helped us crawl out of waterfall, maybe Radical will finally let us <strong>stand upright again</strong>.</p><p>---</p><h3>ðŸ“š References</h3><p>* <a href="https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html">Dave Thomas â€“ "Time to Kill Agile" (2014)</a></p><p>* <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/04/have-we-taken-agile-too-far">Harvard Business Review â€“ "Have We Taken Agile Too Far?"
