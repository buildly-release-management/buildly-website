                    Software maintenance has always been a critical, yet often overlooked, aspect of the software development lifecycle. While creating innovative features and launching products gets all the glory, keeping systems running smoothly, secure, and up-to-date is just as important. However, traditional software maintenance methods are riddled with challenges—long hours spent fixing bugs, responding to performance issues, and patching security vulnerabilities. The good news? AI is here to change all of that.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-buildly-dark mb-6">The Traditional Software Maintenance Process</h2>
                
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    For years, software maintenance has been a manual process. Developers spend countless hours diagnosing bugs, patching vulnerabilities, updating dependencies, and ensuring systems stay secure and functional. And let's not forget the constant firefighting that comes with urgent bug fixes or performance issues that suddenly crop up.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
                    This traditional approach is slow, prone to human error, and, frankly, not scalable. Even with the best development teams, predicting when something will break or managing the complexity of large-scale systems remains a daunting challenge. Unplanned downtime, broken systems, and security breaches are costly outcomes that often happen because maintenance wasn't as proactive as it should have been.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-buildly-dark mb-6">How AI is Revolutionizing Software Maintenance</h2>
                
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">This is where AI comes in.</p>

                <!-- Feature 1 -->
                <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 p-8 rounded-xl mb-8">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-4">1. Predictive Maintenance</h3>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        One of the most exciting uses of AI in software maintenance is predictive maintenance. AI models can analyze vast amounts of historical system data—everything from past errors to performance metrics—and identify patterns that signal potential issues before they become critical.
                    </p>

                    <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
                        <p class="text-blue-700 font-medium mb-4">For example:</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">
                            If AI detects a recurring memory leak or a subtle decrease in system performance, it can flag it early. This way, developers can address issues proactively rather than scrambling to fix them in the middle of a system outage.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p class="text-blue-700 font-medium">
                        In essence, AI is shifting maintenance from a reactive to a proactive practice. By predicting failures ahead of time, teams can prioritize fixes that prevent costly downtime and keep their systems running smoothly.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        There are a lot of routine maintenance tasks that take up a significant chunk of developers' time—things like updating software dependencies, managing patches, or checking configurations. These tasks are important but often repetitive and time-consuming. Enter AI-driven automation.

                        Real-time monitoring has always been a cornerstone of good software maintenance. However, traditional monitoring often relies on predefined thresholds and alerts, which might not always catch emerging issues until they've already impacted users.
